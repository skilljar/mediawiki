TODO:

Medium-prio:
* (testsuite) Provide ~100% automated test coverage of all functionality.
* (feature) Detect absence of any of the 4 needed S3 buckets,
	create them all immediately,
	throw MWException "please create them manually" if createBucket() fails.

Low-prio:
* (third-party) Update AWS PHP SDK to version 3.
	This can only be done in a release version, because current installations
	would require "composer install" after updating Extension:AWS.
